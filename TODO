Following is the list of TODO tasks/features for ruby_curry :

1. Integration of translator system 
		- convert .icur to ruby object code directly
		- this removes the intermediate JSON dependency

	 Added on : 28 May 2016

2. Adding support for inbuilt Curry modules like "Prelude"
		- this will provide support for clauses like "case", "loop", "map" and other
			logical operators
		- find the Curry code for "Prelude", convert to .icur which is then compiled 
			to prelude_objectCode in Ruby. This file can be then included in all other 
			object code files

3. Adding support for Exempt
		- use the $fail_symbol for constructing corresponding expressions

	 Added on : 28 May 2016

4. Handling different datatypes (probably a type system)
		- provide support to most common types like "int", "char", "String"

		Added on : 28 May 2016

5. Problem of global variables in test suite
		- try a custom script to run all test cases instead of Rake
	 Solved : Added a custom rake task itest(independent test). Run with command 
	 "rake itest".

6. Necessary for multiple passes for fully populating symbol table
		- example of odd_even.curry

			even Zero = Zero
			even Succ x = odd x
			odd Zero = Succ Zero
			odd Succ x = even(x)

			Here when ruby_curry is parsing the second rule, it panics as it is unaware 
			of "odd" symbol which is defined later in code.
			
		- could try multiple passes or a forward declaration concept

7. Create a single executable for using ICurry in the Github repo
		- since the ICurry code by itself is big and difficult to setup on any 
			machine, it would be better to create an executable version which can be 
			invoked the translator system that will merged with ruby_curry
